# GH_CaC_WebHook
Automated Configuration as Code deployment using GitHub Webhook to iControl LX Webhook Server.

## Description

F5 has discovered customer interest in automated Configuration-as-Code models. Through the use of GitHub Webhooks, engineers may 'commit' service descriptions to a 'deployment' repo, which results in F5 BIG-IP configurations. Thus, GitHub is provided a familiar developer interface (SCM) with demployment templates, which results in deployed configurations on unfamiliar technology like F5's BIG-IP application delivery controller.

The config description 'commit' may be either JSON or YAML configuration data which, via a GitHub webhook, is communicated to an F5 iControl LX worker (a declarative interface). The iControl LX worker translates the [JSON|YAML] payload into a BIG-IP service configuration.

**Concepts**

**iControl** - The F5 BIG-IP REST API.
**iControl LX** - (iControl Language eXtension) The F5 BIG-IP REST API Framework, upon which customers/partners can create their own custom endpoints/workflows.
**iControl LX worker/microservice** - Some Javascript that is executed every time it's custom endpoint is hit with GET/POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE.

## Workflow
1. Engineer is ready to deploy a service.
2. Engineer visits the "infrastructure as code" repo on GitHub and navigates to the '/templates' directory.
3. Based on their applications/services requirements, the engineer selects the appropriate template. e.g. "Basic load-balancing", "SSL Offload", "Web Application Firewall", and so on.
4. Engineer creates a new file in the '/deploy' directory using the template [JSON|YAML] (we could support both/either), and enters the unique deployment-specific data, e.g.: service name, server IP addresses, etc. **NOTE:** See template example below.
5. A GitHub Webhook, configured with custom F5 iControl LX worker REST endpoint (a Webhook server) destination, communicates the commit as 'added', 'modified', or 'removed'.
6. The iControl LX worker consumes and processes as appropriate.
  1. If the webhook message indicates "added" or "modified", the webhook wil retreive the data from GitHub and perform the add (if "added"), or Nuke and Pave (if "modified").
  2. If the message is "removed", there is no requirement to retrieve the data from GitHub and the service configuration is immediately removed form the BIG-IP device.


## Example template
Example Service Template, where engineer would replace the values in `{{}}`:

```
{
  "name": "{{example-f5-http-lb}}",
  "tenantTemplateReference": {
    "link": "https://localhost/mgmt/cm/cloud/tenant/templates/iapp/f5-http-lb"
  },
  "vars": [
    {
      "name": "pool__addr",
      "value": "{{appsvcs_vip_addr}}"
    },
    {
      "name": "pool__port",
      "value": "{{appsvcs_vip_port}}"
    }
  ],
  "tables": [
    {
      "name": "pool__Members",
      "columns": [
        "IPAddress",
        "State"
      ],
      "rows": [
        [
          "{{appsvcs_member1_addr}}",
          "enabled"
        ],
        [
          "{{appsvcs_member2_addr}}",
          "enabled"
        ]
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
